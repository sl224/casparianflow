# Claude Context Documents

This folder contains documentation to help Claude (and other AI assistants) understand the Casparian Flow project quickly.

## Documents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `project-overview.md` | High-level architecture, tech stack, directory structure |
| `ui-testing.md` | Blind Agent UI testing framework - how to run and write tests |

## Usage

When starting a new Claude session, reference these docs:
```
Read claude_docs/project-overview.md for project context
Read claude_docs/ui-testing.md for UI testing patterns
```

## Adding New Docs

Add context docs here when:
- A complex subsystem needs explanation
- There are non-obvious patterns future sessions should know
- Troubleshooting guides would save time
