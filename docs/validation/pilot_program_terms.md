# Casparian Flow - Pilot Program Terms

**Status:** Canonical
**Date:** January 2026
**Target:** DFIR / Incident Response vertical (primary)

---

## 1. Pilot Program Overview

### Philosophy

Pilots are **paid and time-boxed**. This filters serious buyers from tire-kickers and avoids the "free pilot + custom parser development" trap.

### What We're Offering

- **Paid pilot access** to Casparian Flow for 30 days ($1,000)
- **Dedicated onboarding** (1-hour setup call)
- **Direct access** to founding team for feedback
- **Full pilot credit** toward annual purchase

### What We're Asking

- **Single check-in** call at Day 14
- **Honest feedback** on product and value
- **Go/no-go decision** by Day 30
- **No scope expansion** beyond agreed use case

### What's NOT Included

- Custom parser development
- Extended pilot duration
- Scope expansion mid-pilot
- Refunds (credit is forward-only)

## 2. Pilot Selection Criteria

### Ideal Pilot Partner (DFIR)

- [ ] Role: DFIR Consultant, Forensic Engineer, IR Lead
- [ ] Pain: Currently using fragile Python scripts for artifact parsing
- [ ] Data: Has case folder or evidence bundle to process
- [ ] Authority: Can approve $1,200-4,800/year tool purchase
- [ ] Timeline: Active need (not "maybe someday")

### Disqualifying Factors

- No clear pain point (just "exploring")
- Expects custom parser development as part of pilot
- Cannot commit to 30-day timeline
- Wants free extended trial
- No budget authority

## 9. FAQ (For Pilots)

**Q: What happens to my data after the pilot?**
A: Nothing. All data stays on your machines. We never see it.

**Q: Can I extend the pilot?**
A: No. Extensions delay decisions. 30 days is enough to evaluate.

**Q: What if I need a custom parser?**
A: Write it yourself or hire a consultant. We don't develop custom parsers as part of pilots or licenses.

**Q: Will the pilot fee be refunded if I don't convert?**
A: No. The fee is non-refundable but credits toward annual purchase.

**Q: Can my whole team use this during the pilot?**
A: Yes, up to 5 users during pilot.
