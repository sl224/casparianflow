### Version A: Pain-First

```
Subject: Trade break resolution - 5 min vs 45 min?

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How long does it take your team to debug a trade break today?

I've talked to ops teams at [similar firms] who spend 30-45 minutes per break
grepping through FIX logs, piecing together order lifecycles in Excel.

We built something that turns that into a 5-minute SQL query.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see if it's relevant to [Company]?

No pitch - just want to understand if this is a real pain point for your team.

[Your name]

P.S. - If you're not the right person, who handles trade break resolution
on your desk?
```

### Version B: Credibility-First

```
Subject: Quick question about your FIX log workflow

Hi [First Name],

I'm [Your name], founder of Casparian Flow. We help trading ops teams
query FIX logs with SQL instead of grep.

Before we launch publicly, I'm talking to 20 ops leaders to understand
how teams actually handle trade break resolution today.

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick call? Not a sales pitch -
genuinely trying to learn.

Happy to share what we're hearing from other firms in return.

[Your name]
```

### Version C: Value-First

```
Subject: T+1 pressure on your trade support team?

Hi [First Name],

Since T+1 went live, I've heard from ops teams that trade break resolution
is now a daily fire drill.

We built a tool that reconstructs FIX order lifecycles into a SQL table.
Query by ClOrdID, see the full lifecycle in seconds.

Curious if this matches what you're seeing at [Company]?

15 minutes to compare notes?

[Your name]

## Email 2: Follow-Up (Day 3-4)

```
Subject: Re: [Original subject]

Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note from [Day].

I know ops teams are slammed, so I'll keep this short:

We're offering 3 trading desks free access to Casparian for 30 days
to test our FIX log analysis tool.

If trade break resolution is eating your team's time, might be worth
a quick look.

Open to a 15-minute call this week?

[Your name]
```

## Email 3: Break-Up Email (Day 7-10)

```
Subject: Closing the loop

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a couple times about FIX log analysis for trade ops.

I'll assume the timing isn't right and close this out.

If trade break resolution becomes a priority, feel free to reach out.
We'll be here.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - If there's someone else at [Company] I should talk to about this,
I'd appreciate the intro.

## LinkedIn Connection Request

```
Hi [First Name] - I'm researching how trading ops teams handle trade
break resolution post-T+1. Would love to hear how [Company] approaches it.
Open to a quick chat?

## LinkedIn InMail (If Not Connected)

Hi [First Name],

I'm building a tool that helps trading ops teams query FIX logs with SQL
instead of grep + Excel.

Before we launch, I'm talking to 20 ops leaders to understand the reality
of trade break resolution today.

Would you have 15 minutes for a call? Not a sales pitch - genuinely trying
to learn what's working and what's not.

Happy to share patterns we're seeing across firms.

Thanks,

### If They Say "Not Me, Try X"

```
Thanks for the redirect! I'll reach out to [X].

Quick question before I do - what's the biggest ops headache you're
seeing right now? Just curious.

[Your name]
```

### If They Say "We Don't Have This Problem"

```
That's great to hear! Most teams I talk to are drowning in manual
FIX log analysis.

What's your secret? I'd love to understand what's working for [Company].

[Your name]
```

### If They Say "Send Me Info"

```
Sure thing. Here's a 2-minute overview:

[Loom video link OR one-pager PDF]

The TL;DR: We turn FIX logs into a SQL table called `fix_order_lifecycle`.
Query by ClOrdID, symbol, or time range. See the full trade lifecycle
in seconds.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits your workflow?
