### Follow-Up Questions
1. "What value have you gotten from Casparian so far?"
2. "How much time has this saved you per week?"
3. "What would you need to see to justify $X/month to your manager?"
4. "If we offered [Team tier] at $2,000/month, would that be in budget?"
5. "What would make this a 'no-brainer' purchase?"

### Pricing Options to Present

|------|-------|-----------------|
| **Team** | $2,000/month | 5 users, all parsers, priority support |

**Offer:** 50% discount for first 3 months for pilot converts (loyalty reward)

## 10. FAQ (For Pilots)

**Q: What happens to my data after the pilot?**
A: Nothing. All data stays on your machines. We never see it.

**Q: Can I extend the pilot?**
A: We prefer to make a decision at Day 30. Extensions signal unclear value.

**Q: What if I need a feature that doesn't exist?**
A: Tell us. We'll build it if it makes sense (and you convert).

**Q: Will prices go up after the pilot?**
A: Pilot converters get 50% off for 3 months, then standard pricing.

**Q: Can my whole team use this?**
A: Yes, up to 5 users during pilot. More requires paid tier.
